# Stock Price Analysis and Forecasting

This repository contains the R Markdown file for a stock price analysis and forecasting project. The analysis is aimed at predicting stock prices using various statistical methods and machine learning algorithms.

## Project Overview

This project was part of my dissertation submitted in August 2024. The goal is to analyze historical stock market data and forecast future trends using various data visualization techniques and machine learning models.

### Key Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleansing and transforming stock price data for analysis.
- Data Visualization: Using `ggplot2` and `plotly` to create interactive graphs that display trends.
- Predictive Modeling: Leveraging statistical models and machine learning algorithms for stock price forecasting.

## File Structure

- **complete_dissertation.Rmd**: The R Markdown file containing the entire analysis, from data import to forecasting results.
  - **Libraries Used**: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`, and more for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
  - **Outputs**: The file is configured to generate output in HTML, Word, and PDF formats.

## Dependencies

To run the R Markdown file successfully, you need to install the following R packages:
- `tidyverse`
- `dplyr`
- `ggplot2`
- `plotly`

These can be installed using the following R code:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "plotly"))
